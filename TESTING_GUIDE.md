# EchoToken Contract Testing Guide

This guide shows you how to test the EchoToken contract using Hardhat. The contract is a simple ERC20-like token with basic functionality including minting, burning, transfers, and approvals.

## Setup

The project is already configured with:
- Hardhat framework
- Chai testing library  
- Ethers.js for blockchain interactions
- Multiple Solidity compiler versions (0.8.19 and 0.8.3)

## Contract Functions

### Core ERC20 Functions
- `name()` - Returns token name
- `symbol()` - Returns token symbol  
- `decimals()` - Returns 18 (standard)
- `totalSupply()` - Returns total token supply
- `balanceOf(address)` - Returns token balance for an address
- `transfer(to, amount)` - Transfer tokens to another address
- `approve(spender, amount)` - Approve another address to spend tokens
- `allowance(owner, spender)` - Check approved amount
- `transferFrom(from, to, amount)` - Transfer tokens on behalf of another address

### Additional Functions
- `mint(to, amount)` - Create new tokens (increases total supply)
- `burn(from, amount)` - Destroy tokens (decreases total supply)

## Running Tests

### 1. Compile the Contracts
```bash
npm run compile
```

### 2. Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### 3. Run Tests with Verbose Output
```bash
npm run test:verbose
```

### 4. Run Interactive Demo
```bash
npm run demo
```

## Test Coverage

The comprehensive test suite covers:

### ‚úÖ **Deployment Tests**
- Correct token name and symbol setting
- Proper decimals (18)
- Zero initial supply
- Zero initial balances

### ‚úÖ **Minting Tests** 
- Basic minting functionality
- Multiple address minting
- Large amount handling
- Zero amount edge case
- Total supply tracking

### ‚úÖ **Burning Tests**
- Basic burning functionality
- Underflow protection (fails when burning more than balance)
- Complete balance burning
- Zero amount edge case
- Total supply reduction

### ‚úÖ **Transfer Tests**
- Basic transfers between accounts
- Underflow protection (fails when transferring more than balance)
- Zero amount transfers
- Self-transfers
- Balance tracking

### ‚úÖ **Approval & TransferFrom Tests**
- Approval setting and events
- TransferFrom with sufficient allowance
- TransferFrom failure with insufficient allowance
- Owner can transferFrom their own tokens without approval
- Exact allowance amount handling
- Allowance updates
- Zero allowance setting

### ‚úÖ **View Functions Tests**
- All getter functions return correct values
- State tracking through operations

### ‚úÖ **Edge Cases & Error Conditions**
- Maximum uint256 value handling
- Arithmetic underflow protection
- Multiple consecutive operations
- Gas usage estimation

```

## Interactive Demo Features

The demo script (`npm run demo`) demonstrates:

1. **Contract Deployment** - Deploys with custom name/symbol
2. **Information Display** - Shows all contract metadata
3. **Minting** - Creates 1000 tokens for owner
4. **Transfer** - Moves 250 tokens to another address
5. **Approval & TransferFrom** - Sets allowance and transfers on behalf
6. **Burning** - Destroys 100 tokens from owner
7. **Final State** - Shows all balances and total supply
8. **Error Cases** - Demonstrates transaction failures

## Gas Usage Information

The tests also provide gas usage estimates:
- Mint: ~68,385 gas
- Transfer: ~51,621 gas  
- Approve: ~46,167 gas

## Key Contract Behaviors

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- The contract uses basic arithmetic that will revert on underflow (Solidity 0.8.x)
- No access controls - anyone can call `mint()` and `burn()`
- No maximum supply limit
- TransferFrom allows owners to transfer their own tokens without approval
- All standard ERC20 events are emitted (`Transfer`, `Approval`)

### üîí **Security Considerations**  
- Basic underflow protection through Solidity 0.8.x
- No reentrancy guards (not needed for this simple implementation)
- No ownership or permission system
- No pause/emergency stop functionality

## Additional Commands

```bash
# Start local Hardhat node
npm run node

# Open Hardhat console
npm run console

# Clean and recompile
npx hardhat clean && npm run compile
```

This testing setup provides comprehensive coverage of all contract functionality and demonstrates best practices for Hardhat testing with ES modules.
